I graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a B.S. degree in Mathematics (1st class) and I am currently a student-athlete completing my M.S in Mathematics whilst also competing in cross country and track in the NCAA (Division 1). I am ambitious to continuously develop in Machine Learning and Data Science, and apply this knowledge to a vast range of fields. 
I am able to work unsupervised or as a member of a team. A student-athlete with demonstrated time management skills and strong team leadership and team-building abilities. Keen to transfer knowledge and skills in any work environment, as well as to obtain new ones. Dedicated and hardworking with the internal drive to address complex mathematics, modeling challenges, and deliver high-quality results.
